# You may do your work by editing this file, or by typing code at the
# command line and copying it into the appropriate part of this file when
# you are done.  When you are done, running this file should compute and
# print the answers to all the problems.

### Problem 3 (Creating Dictionaries)
### Create a dictionary associated with these awesome bands and their legendary lead singers. Freddy Mercury and Queen, Kurt Cobain and Nirvana, Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits. By the end, it should look like this:
Lead Singers = {'Freddy Mercury' : Queen, 'Kurt Cobain' : Nirvana, 'Mark Knopfler' : Dire Straits}


# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 3 solution follows:"

# ... write your code and comments here (and remove this line)


###
### Problem 4 (Assertions)
### Let's set these legendary singers to equal to 1. Now let's add Justin Bieber and have him equal to 0. Assert a statement that returns a value that is less than 1 that will say "Not a legendary singer, but a whiny little bitch" Print out each of the singers and the statement should either be that, or "Bloody amazing, have my babies?"

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 4 solution follows:"

# ... write your code and comments here (and remove this line)


###
### Problem 5( If, Elif and Else)
### Write a code that will put the list of problem 3 in Alphabetical order using if, elif and else. 

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 5 solution follows:"

# ... write your code and comments here (and remove this line)

###
### Problem 6(Data Structures)
### Write Python code creating one of each type of data structure, using the correct kind of grouping symbol (square brackets, curly braces, parentheses, and curly braces with colons inside). 

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 6 solution follows:"

# ... write your code and comments here (and remove this line)

###
### Problem 7
###Now let's add more bands and singers and include them in the dictionary. Billie Joe Armstrong and Greenday, Matthew Bellamy and Muse, Jimi Hendrix and Band of Gypsys, John Lennon and The Beattles. Come up with a way to find out if the singers are currently alive and at the end, print out alive and dead. So it should be:
Print Alive
Print Dead

# DO NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING LINE
print "Problem 7 solution follows:"

# ... write your code and comments here (and remove this line)
