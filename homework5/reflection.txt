Homework 3: Election prediction


Collaboration:

Worked on it on my own. 

Reflection:
This was difficult and used a lot of googles help.
I did what I could and had a lot of issues with Canopy
and github on my computer. I had to un install everything
and reinstall Thats the reason for commiting my hw late.
